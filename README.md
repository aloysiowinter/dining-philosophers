## Contributing

### Rules

I only ask for two requirements when contributing:

1. You must provide a working solution to the DPP
2. Your solution must be Object Oriented

### How to Contribute

1. Fork and clone this repo
2. Add code for the new variant
    - If you want to add a different solution to an already existing language then simply put it in a sub-directory under that language like so: `<language_dir>/<my_variant_dir>/`
3. Create a `README.md` for your variant that describes:
    - The language used.
    - The methods used in the solution (i.e. Mutex/Semaphore, Arbitrator, Chandy/Misra)
    - Instructions on how to run the code
4. Add a link to the top-level `README.md` to your new solution
5. Open a PR
